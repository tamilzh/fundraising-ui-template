## The Big Question with Two Answers

The big question is, “What is **{__fundraiser__}**?” There are two good answers.

  * It is a fundraiser for **{__beneficiary__}**, raising funds in the cryptocurrency AVAX with NFTs as awards. We call these special NFTs *AwardNFTs*.
  
  Each time you mint or buy an NFT from **{__fundraiser__}**, a portion of the proceeds go to **{__beneficiary__}**, with portions also going to the artist, the fundraiser, and the seller.

  * It is our second example of a **Fund Raisin** fundraiser. 

    **Fund Raisin** is a set of tools that lets anyone create a fundraising website for anything. If you want to raise money, **Fund Raisin** tools help you create your website, partner with an NFT artist, and even publish your website to the cloud. If you would like to create your own **Fund Raisin** fundraiser, or if you are an artist and would like your art to be featured when others use **Fund Raisin**, get in touch!

## Who is Involved?


* [red·dev](https://www.red.dev) is the software company that creates and maintains **Fund Raisin** software.
* [Fund Raisin](https://www.fundraisin.app) is a platform you can use to publish cool **#AwardNFTs** websites.
* [{__fundraiser__}](https://catdrops.fundraisin.app) is our second demonstration of a fully functional **Fund Raisin** fundraising website. (Our first was [The Octopi Collection](https://octopi.fundraisin.app).)
* [Blake Chamberlain](https://blakeart.work/) is the artist who created Catdrops.
* [{__beneficiary__}](https://twitter.com/FUNPROBIANI) is the NGO, based in Maturín, Venezuela, that benefits from this fundraiser. We partnered with FUNPROBIANI because two members of the red·dev team live in Maturín and were able to visit a FUNPROBIANI clinic, meet the director and lead veterinarian, and see them providing quality care to pets and strays in need.




## Catdrop NFTs are #AwardNFTs

You may already be familiar with NFTs, but **{__fundraiser__}** NFTs are  what we call *#AwardNFTs*. Here are some key differences:
1. The primary purpose of Catdrops NFTs are for **fundraising**. In contrast, the primary purpose of most NFTs is for **collecting and trading**. (However, you absolutely can collect Catdrops NFTs, and we have created some rare traits with the collector in mind.) **#AwardNFTs** is an exciting new use-case for NFTs!
   
2. When you mint, you get to choose your Catdrop NFTs traits. This turns normal NFT minting–where you get no choice at all–on its head, and it "gamifys" minting, making it a lot more fun. You want a rare one? Use your creativity to make a rare one!
   
3. One trait, the **Background Color**, determines the minting price and can easily be observed visually throughout the NFT’s life. The idea behind this is that different people will want to donate different amounts of money.
   
4. Minting continues for the entire length of the 21 fundraiser or until 300 have been minted, whichever comes first. If you create your own Fund Raisin fundraiser, you get to choose whether you have limits like these or none at all.
   
5. Rare traits are limited not only by count but also by date. For instance, with Catdrops, the background color with the price of 0.1 AVAX is only available for the first 14 days of the fundraiser.
   
6. Proceeds are split, according to the original minter’s wishes, for the life of the NFT, between **{__beneficiary__}**, the artist, the fundraiser, and the seller. When you mint, you get to choose the split. We make this easy with a series of “alter-egos” that split the funds in some typical ways, but you are welcome to pick exactly the split that you would like. The only restriction is that the shares for *{__beneficiary__}*, the artist, and the sponsor (us) must be at minimum 1%. 

When an NFT sells, it is voluntary on the part of NFT marketplaces to honor the splitting of proceeds. However, currently all marketplaces on Avalanche do honor [this royalty splitting standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2981) which is how we accomplish this task. If you sell you Catdrop using the Catdrops Collection website, royalties will always be split as #AwardNFTs specify.

## What About Me, the NFT Collector?

For the traditional NFT collector, you may be wondering what to do. Fret not! You, the degen collector, can mint Catdrops NFTs and use the **Degen** alter-ego for revenue-splitting, and the NFT you create will be collectable the same way other NFTs are. You will own an NFT where most of the revenue goes to the seller, just as with other NFT collections. The NFTs can be resold on any Avalanche NFT marketplace. And each time it does, a tiny amount will be split off and donated. 

## Fundraising – NFTs Bring More Utility

There are lots of possibilities for how to make **{__fundraiser__}** work for you. Here’s one cool idea to engage your friends else. Each time it sells, more money is raised. In fact, if you’re a wealthy crypto-whale, you could mint  one hundred Catdrops and sell them all, essentially taking on the role of a “corporate sponsor” who matches each smaller gift.

## PASA Tokens

Every time you interact with **{__fundraiser__}** as a minter, buyer, or seller, you also receive PASA tokens. PASA is distributed to everyone who participates in every **Fund Raisin** fundraiser. Think of PASA like frequent flyer miles; PASA has no monetary value, but it may become useful in the future for redeeming special “thank you” NFTs, and for other purposes too. No PASA has been pre-mined. Why “PASA”? *Pasa* means *raisin* in Spanish!

## NFT Licensing
